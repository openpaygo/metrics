## Credits
This open-source project was fully funded and developped by [Solaris Offgrid](https://www.solarisoffgrid.com/), the developers of PaygOpsâ„¢ and is free to use by all. 


## Implementations

### Python Implementation
A [Python implementation](https://github.com/EnAccess/OpenPAYGO-python) is available, implementing OpenPAYGO Metrics as well as OpenPAYGO Token for use either on server side or on device side. 

### Arduino Implementation
An Arduino library for the device side is currently being worked on. More information will be posted here once a working version is available. If you would like to contribute or sponsor this project, or if you would like to be added to the registry of current user, open an issue in the issue tracker to let us know. 

## Getting Started

OpenPAYGO Metrics provide a standardized way for PAYGO devices to send usage metrics to a server and get back information about their activation status in a low cost and secure way. The specification is designed so that the payload is very lightweight while additional information about the data format can be provided to allow servers to display and process the data with a lot of details. It is currently in active use by multiple software providers and manufacturers. 

To get started implementing, check out [that document](https://github.com/openpaygo/metrics/blob/main/Specifications.md) that describes the detailed specification of the OpenPAYGO Metrics payload and API.
